    <p class="subjectText">ECTS: 7</p>

    <p class="subjectText">The Algorithms and Data Structures course is crucial for TSIW students as it provides essential problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of how to design and implement efficient algorithms. By mastering concepts like algorithmic notation, control structures, data types, and modular decomposition, students can effectively tackle computational challenges. Moreover, learning to develop applications using Python and the tkinter library prepares them for real-world programming tasks, making this subject fundamental for their success in web information systems. </p>
